Description[[[ The AP U.S. History course develops studentsâ€™ understanding of American history from approximately 1491 to the present. Students will investigate U.S. history for significant events, individuals, developments, and processes across historical periods. Students will develop the same thinking skills and methods used by historians: analysis of primary and secondary sources, contextualization, comparison, causation, continuity and change over time, and argumentation. The course also looks at seven themes: American and national identity; politics and power; work, exchange, and technology; culture and society; migration and settlement; geography and the environment; and America in the world. Students will explore these themes in order to make connections among historical developments in different times and places in preparation for the AP U. S. History Exam and/or future college-level history courses.
