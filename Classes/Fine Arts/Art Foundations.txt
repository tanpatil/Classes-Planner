Description[[[ Foundations of Art is an introductory and survey course. Foundations of Art provides a variety of experiences that build on concepts and techniques. It is designed to answer the question “What is Art?” Answers to this question are discovered through the exploration of two-dimensional and three- dimensional formats. Art history, design and composition, and aesthetic criticism are integrated into the curriculum. The purpose of this course is to strengthen art skills, broaden students’ knowledge and appreciation of art, and bring awareness as it appears in the world around them. This course will prepare students for additional art courses. Independent work in a studio setting is a frequent expectation.
