Description[[[ This class is for students who have been selected as a member of the Guard. This class is open by audition only. Participation in Competitive Marching Band Guard (CMB) is based on one’s knowledge and skills in the Fall CMB music and sets. Summer Band camp is highly recommended because it focuses solely on the Fall CMB music and sets. Students without adequate knowledge and skills in the Fall CMB music and sets are welcome and may participate as an alternate in the CMB. Guard members are expected to attend all after school rehearsals, generally two per week during marching season, but additional rehearsals may be called. Guard members also perform with the marching band at all functions including football games, playoff games and marching contests. Students who participate in color guard receive a ½ credit in Wellness C.
