Description[[[ The AP Studio Art Course is designed for students who wish to assemble a body of artwork that demonstrates a high level of quality. The course prepares students for three different AP Exams. Students choose from a 2-D design portfolio (including photography), drawing portfolio, or 3-D Design portfolio. Students work to develop a mastery of concept, composition and execution of their personal ideas and themes in one of the chosen portfolio areas. The course emphasizes art making as an ongoing process involving critical thinking, personal expression, as well as a variety of concepts and approaches in design problem solving. The course examines three aspects of portfolio development; quality, concentration and breadth. Throughout the year, the students complete work towards these three sections. Breadth will be teacher driven although previous quality work may be considered for this section. The development of a personal concentrated body of work will be of the studentâ€™s own choosing. The concentration will focus on a group of related works. These works must demonstrate a serious purpose and show growth over time.
