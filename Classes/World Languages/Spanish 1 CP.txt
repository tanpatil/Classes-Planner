Description[[[ Spanish I is an entry-level course designed for students with no previous language study or for students with limited proficiency in prior elementary, middle school, or Spanish 1 courses. The main focus of the course is on the development of communication proficiency in the target language. Grammatical concepts and vocabulary will be taught in context from within six cultural themes: Family and Communities, Science and Technology, World Challenges, Beauty and Aesthetics, Personal and Public Identities, and Contemporary Life. These cultural themes will be explored through authentic sources, such as news articles, video clips, music, literature, etc. and may be supplemented by a textbook. There is an emphasis in the use of technology as it provides a venue for students to enhance their speaking and listening comprehension.
