Description[[[ AP Physics 1 and 2 is for students planning to major in science or engineering in college. The course covers the College Board standards for both algebra-based AP Physics courses including mechanics, dynamics, waves and light, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics and modern Physics. It is the required prerequisite course for calculus based AP Physics C. Because the class covers two complete AP courses two periods are required. A guided study period will be included 1-2 times per week.
