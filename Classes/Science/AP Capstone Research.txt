Description[[[ In AP Research, students develop the skills and discipline necessary to conduct independent research to produce and defend a scholarly academic thesis. This second course in the AP Capstone experience allows students to explore deeply an academic topic, problem, or issue of individual interest and through this inquiry, students design, plan, and conduct a year-long mentored, research-based investigation. The course culminates in an academic thesis paper of approximately 5,000 words and a presentation, performance, or exhibition with an oral defense. Students who earn scores of 3 or higher in AP Seminar and AP Research will receive the AP Seminar and Research Certificate™. Students who also earn scores of 3 or higher on four additional AP Exams of their choice will receive the AP Capstone Diploma™.
