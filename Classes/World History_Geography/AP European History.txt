Description[[[ AP European History focuses on developing studentsâ€™ abilities to think conceptually about European history from approximately 1450 to the present and apply historical thinking skills as they learn about the past. The development of modern Europe is addressed through the social, political, religious, intellectual, technological, and economic histories of the various peoples and nations of Europe and their interactions with the wider world. In addition to the reading, writing, and discussion activities characteristic of an AP humanities course, students will have opportunities to explore areas of particular interest through projects of their own design to connect European history to their other areas of academic and cultural interest. This course is designed to be the equivalent of a two-semester introductory college or university European history course and will prepare students for the AP exam.
