Description[[[ Offered from Tennessee College of Applied Technology on Oak Ridge Schools Campus. Nursing Education consists of 18 units of study dealing with direct bedside nursing care. Students can be registered by the Tennessee Department of Health—after the completion of the course, 100 hours clinical and theory, passing a state test (both written and skills)—and will be job ready. Jobs include registered nurse, clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, nurse anesthetist, forensic nurse, and other occupations. This Dual Enrollment course includes theory and clinical training in basic nursing skills; patient personal care and hygiene/ communication, and interpersonal interaction; ethical and legal responsibilities; infection control methods; safety measures; rehabilitation and restorative care; and patient mental health needs. Employment as a Certified Nurse Assistant typically requires the person to meet general health standards, and requires heavy physical tasks such as lifting, pushing, or pulling required objects up to 50 lbs. It also requires lifting clients who might weigh up to 200 pounds. For employment, aides must be in good health; a physical exam might be required; and a criminal background check is generally a prerequisite. Aides should be tactful, patient, understanding, emotionally stable, and dependable. They should desire to help people. Upon successful completion of the course materials and 120 required hours of training (one period per day in a semester-long class plus 25 evenings of clinical experience hours), students will be awarded a certificate and a grade report that serve as documentation of the successful completion and the training hours attended. These students are then eligible to sit for the State of Tennessee’s Nurse Aid Test to become a Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA).
