# ORHS-Classes
This is an iOS app project that digitalizes the schedule building at Oak Ridge High School. The traditional method of printing out course catalogs is not sufficient to help students build 4 year schedules effectively. With this app, students will be able to understand their course load better and plan a schedule fitting to them while meeting graduation requirements.
