Description[[[ French Club is for students who are enrolled in French, have taken French, or just like French! We welcome other lanugage students, as well. In the past, we have watched French movies and eaten snacks, celebrated holidays, sponsored an Angel Tree, worked Concessions to donate to the Family Resource Center, had lunch at Panera, met for movies at Tinseltown, and have gone bowling. We have painted, designed T-shirts, and had a marshmellow monunment building contest.
