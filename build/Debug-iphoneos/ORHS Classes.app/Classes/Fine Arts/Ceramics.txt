Description[[[ Ceramics is a studio art course in which students will create hand built and wheel thrown clay pieces. Students must have a strong interest in working with clay materials. Students will learn basic hand- building, wheel throwing, firing, and alternative clay techniques. Students will create and design sculptural, functional, and well-crafted works of art as they relate to ceramics. There is a significant amount of studio maintenance required in this class and a grade is calculated for this activity. Attendance is an important factor in this class and will be considered when students apply for the course. Tools and materials are not available for home use and in the event of absences the student must make arrangements to make up class time during lunch, guided study or after school.
