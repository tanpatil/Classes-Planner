Description[[[ Youth Leadership Development and Community Involvement Program (YLDCIP) is a community-based learning and service program that utilizes the community as the classroom. The purpose of YLDCIP is to develop student civic awareness, responsibility, and leadership through involvement in projects that are beneficial to the community. Students will work with a mentor at an off-campus organization that serves the community (other schools, non-profit organizations, religious organizations, government agencies, etc.) on-site each day during the YLDCIP period. Students will choose an area of interest and, under the guidance of their community mentor and the teacher, design an action-research project. During the first semester, each student will identify a project that can help their host organization and research project strategies. Each full-year student will implement the project and report on the outcomes.
