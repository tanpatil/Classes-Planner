Description[[[ The major goal of this course is to teach students to think like a sociologist by approaching sociology as a science. The student will learn concepts, principles, theories and methods used by sociologists in the examination of social life. The tools of sociological inquiry are then applied to the study of contemporary social issues such as cultural diversity, conformity and adaptation, social institutions and their roles in society, personality development, problems of adolescence, deviance and social control, poverty in America, race relations, sex roles, social change and collective behavior. Students will learn to develop a sociological imagination which will enable them to perceive how people's lives are shaped by their social environment and how the social environment is in turn shaped by people. It is hoped that students will learn to understand and appreciate social diversity and become more open to new ideas and philosophies.
