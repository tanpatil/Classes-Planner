Description[[[ This course is designed to prepare students to interact in a global community. Communication is the emphasis along with vocabulary expansion within the six cultural themes: Family and Communities, Science and Technology, World Challenges, Beauty and Aesthetics, Personal and Public Identities, and Contemporary Life. Students will refine fluency and grammatical accuracy by using the three modes of communication: Interpersonal (speaking, listening, and writing), Presentational (speaking and writing), and Interpretative (reading and listening). Materials include authentic sources such as radio talk shows, news articles, emails, and music from Spanish-speaking countries in order to maximize communication in real-life situations and gain cultural understanding. Classes are conducted entirely in Spanish and students are expected to speak only Spanish in class. In addition, students are also encouraged to seek opportunities to use the target language outside of the classroom. In preparation for the AP Exam in Spanish Language and Culture, students will be taught specific test-taking strategies and will practice for the exam.
