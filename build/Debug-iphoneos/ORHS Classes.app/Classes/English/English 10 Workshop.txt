Description[[[ This course is designed for students who have been formally assessed as having serious difficulties in reading and writing. Placement is determined through the RTI committee for Tier III Intervention. Assessments used to determine a student’s area of need include the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Aimsweb, STAR, writing samples, and TNReady scores. The student’s academic difficulties and deficiencies will be assessed and analyzed in order to have a holistic view of the student. Developmental reading skills are taught through various fiction and nonfiction literary selections chosen by the student and/or teacher. Students develop critical thinking and discussion skills through the study of a multicultural selection of short stories, nonfiction, novels, poetry, and drama. Students practice recognizing ideas, arranging events in sequence, and supporting opinions with examples. The writing responses emphasize organizing for clarity. Writing assignments are designed to improve reading and writing skills and often stress summaries and explanations of the reading. Daily attendance, completion of assigned work, reading practice, and mastery of state standards will make for success in the course. Literature selections include significant pieces of American Literature.
