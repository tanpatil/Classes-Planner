Description[[[ This course is designed for students who want a demanding college level course and who plan to take the Advanced Placement Examination in English Literature and Composition at the end of senior year. This course focuses on British and American literature, and requires students to write advanced literary analysis and read challenging works that span the Anglo-Saxon to modern eras. Students should expect to spend at least an hour outside of class each day on homework. A culminating group research project focuses on a literary period and two major works of the period. Students should also be aware that issues that might form particular social, historical, or cultural viewpoints be considered controversial, including references to ethnicities, nationalities, religions, races, dialects, gender, or class, may be addressed in tests that are appropriate for the AP English Literature and Composition course. Fair representation of issues and peoples may occasionally include controversial material. Since AP students have chosen a program that directly involves them in college level work, participation in this course depends on a level of maturity consistent with the age of high school students who have engaged in thoughtful analyses of a variety of texts.
