This course is open to any student who is interested in the study and practice of descriptive and narrative writing. Poetry, short stories, children’s stories, personal essays, and scripts provide models for students to discuss and imitate. Students work on finding individual voice, enhancing description, developing characters, improvising with imagery and language, experimenting with different genres and forms, and increasing self-confidence. Journal writing and peer editing are critical elements of the course. Students are expected to develop and submit some work for publication or competition. With instructor approval, a second half credit may be earned for an additional semester's work.
