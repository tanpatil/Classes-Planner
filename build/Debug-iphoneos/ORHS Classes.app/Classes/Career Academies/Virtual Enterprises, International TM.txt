Description[[[ Virtual Enterprises, Internationalâ„¢ (VE) is a simulated business environment. The VE students will be involved in actual onthe-job work experiences including accounting, personnel, administration, management, and marketing. The only difference between the VE company and an actual business is that no material goods are produced or legal tender exchanged; however, services will be provided. Working in a team, the student will develop and enhance oral and written communication skills through initiative, responsibility, and creativity. The VE experience will weave together several academic disciplines and occupational subjects, thereby overcoming fragmentation of subjects. The course will link learning to application and real life experiences. The goal is to create a learning environment that, through a series of activities, integrates school and workplace to enhance learning. Laboratory facilities and experiences simulate those found in business and industry. The VE course includes the creation/operation of a virtual business. This practice company will design, produce and market a virtual product to other practice companies via the Internet. Students in the Business Academy will come together to utilize and combine their skills and expertise in the business environment. Students will use a variety of software.
