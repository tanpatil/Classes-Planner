Description[[[ Advanced Technological Applications is a course in which students study components of the designed world. Units include: Engineering Design, Graphics and Spatial Skills, in which students develop the ability to communicate different information of technical drawings and display and understanding of geometric construction. Cybersecurity, in which students learn how we manage our lives digitally from banking and paying bills to online shopping and completing applications, recognizing that personal and company information needs to be kept secure. It is important that students understand cybersecurity to keep their digital lives safe and spot cyber scams. Biotechnology, which has become entrenched in our daily lives in ways that we do not even realize. As our understanding of the applicability of biotechnology grows, we further explore solutions to resolve technological constraints that once inhibited our societyâ€™s advancement. Information Technology, modeling and prediction based on visualization of data and testing design involves changing inputs on the fly to see the effects on the outcomes; and Robotics, in which students learn how robotics and automation technologies have a significant impact on our daily lives. From temperature controls in our homes to high tech manufacturing to agricultural applications, automating inputs, processes and outputs has the potential to make our lives easier, safer and more interesting. Students are engaged in context rich applications such as home automation, agricultural crop harvest, prosthetics and self-driving cars. Engineering Design focuses on how engineers apply their creativity, resourcefulness, mathematical, scientific, and technical knowledge and skills in the creation or refinement of technological products/systems. A key approach will be the employment of a sophisticated, sequential, and iterative design and development process to solve authentic engineering tasks/problems. Units include Fundamentals of Design Engineering, Elements of Design, Structural Design/Modeling/Prototyping/Protecting Ideas, Product and Systems Engineering, and Analysis Management.
