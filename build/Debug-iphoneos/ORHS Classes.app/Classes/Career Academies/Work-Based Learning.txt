Description[[[ Student must have completed an additional Business Academy course during the junior year or be enrolled in the course as a senior. Work-Based Learning (Work-Based Learning: Career Practicum) is a capstone course intended to provide students with opportunities to apply the skills and knowledge learned in previous Business Academy and general education courses within a professional work environment. The course allows students to earn high school credit for select models of work-based learning, which allow students to interact with the industry professionals in order to extend and deepen classroom work and support the development of postsecondary and career readiness knowledge and skills. Through Work-Based Learning, students participate in individual work-based learning experiences in professional settings when they meet the hours required for full-time course equivalent. Upon completion of the Work-Based Learning experience, students will be prepared for postsecondary and career opportunities aligned with their interests and demonstrate professional-quality employability skills relevant to their chosen career paths. Students will participate in class instruction during 8th period every day for approximately the first three weeks of school and will continue once a month on the first Wednesday of each month for the remainder of the year. (Due to the school calendar, some meetings may potentially be rescheduled throughout the year). Both the classroom performance and the WBL on-the-job component are to be evaluated in determining a student’s composite grade. Students must maintain 90% attendance both in school and at work. Please note that students who participate in the work-based learning program may be subject to alcohol and/or drug testing by the third-party organization/employer. The third-party organization/employer may require parental consent to conduct the testing depending on the student’s age.
