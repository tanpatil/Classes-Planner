Description[[[ Entrepreneurship is an applied knowledge course that begins with the discovery process of generating new business ideas. Students research local, national, and international social and economic trends and analyze the feasibility of their own proposed businesses, both from a market demand and revenue-producing standpoint. Based on their entrepreneurial endeavors, students will prepare, write, and revise a business plan. In preparation for the business plan, students will conduct market research, study ownership structures, evaluate risks, examine startup costs, determine essential vendors, and identify sources of capital and financing options. Students will also draft, refine, and rehearse entrepreneurship pitches developed from their business plans to present during course intervals and to give final presentations at the conclusion of the course. Upon conclusion of this course, proficient students will be able to articulate, and defend, elements of a full business plan for a new business.
