Description[[[ Students must apply to become members of the National Honor Society in the fall or spring. The application schedule will be announced in the daily bulletin and on posters around the school. ORHS applicants must be seniors in the fall or rising seniors in the spring. Only those applicants with a 3.6 GPA or higher who have no (or very few) discipline referrals, and can earn the support of the ORHS faculty, will be accepted. Students in the National Honor Society meet once a month after school on Mondays in LC327, and they are expected to help with selling concessions to raise money for the annual scholarship, help after school with peer academic tutoring, serve at specific ORHS events such as commencement, and participate in other community service opportunities.
